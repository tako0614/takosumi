/**
 * Activity audit ledger contract.
 *
 * Activity is the Workspace-scoped audit trail surfaced in the dashboard's Activity
 * view. One {@link ActivityEvent} records a single state-changing action
 * inside a Workspace — an Capsule created, a plan / apply / destroy run reaching
 * a milestone, a Dependency added, stale propagation, a RunGroup created — keyed
 * by the Workspace so the dashboard can list a Workspace's recent activity.
 *
 * This is the PUBLIC, Workspace-level audit trail. It is distinct from the public
 * run-level `RunAuditEvent` projection (the per-run policy / lease / dispatch
 * trace carried inside a Run response); the two never share a type.
 *
 * Security invariant: an ActivityEvent records WHAT happened, not secrets.
 * `metadata` carries identifiers, names, digests, and counts only — never
 * credential material and never resolved output VALUES: secret outputs and
 * credential values are never stored as public ledger values.

 *   - `actorId`    — the principal that triggered the action, when known.
 *   - `action`     — a dotted action verb (`installation.created`,
 *                    `run.plan_created`, `run.approved`, `run.applied`,
 *                    `run.destroyed`, `installation.stale`,

 *   - `targetType` — the kind of entity the action targeted
 *                    (`installation` / `run` / `dependency` / `connection` /
 *                    `run_group` / `space`).
 *   - `targetId`   — the targeted entity id.
 *   - `runId`      — the Run this event belongs to, for run lifecycle events.
 *   - `metadata`   — non-secret structured context (names / ids / digests /
 *                    counts only).
 *   - `createdAt`  — ISO-8601 timestamp.
