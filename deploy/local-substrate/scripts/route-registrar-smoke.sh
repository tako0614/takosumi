#   1. The route-registrar container is running.
#   2. Its tick loop is producing 'synced N dynamic' log lines (proves Caddy
#      admin PATCH is succeeding).
#   3. Caddy admin srv0/routes is reachable and returns the expected count
#      of static routes (proves the partition strategy isn't accidentally
#      dropping Caddyfile-owned routes).
#
# Note: Takosumi v1's public installer API does not expose raw desired routes.
# Dynamic <id>.app.takosumi.test projection is deferred until an operator-
# internal route source lands; this smoke is the registrar wiring guard.
