# P0 local-substrate approval record (FIXTURE)

**This is NOT a real approval record.** It is a deterministic file the
local-substrate uses to satisfy the
`TAKOSUMI_ACCOUNTS_MANAGED_OFFERING_APPROVAL_REF` requirement of the worker's
managed-offering gate. The gate insists the approval ref must differ from the
evidence ref (`p0-local-evidence.md`); this file exists solely to be a distinct
second pointer.

Real launches use approval records tracked in
`takos-private/docs/launch-readiness/`, with a human reviewer's signature, audit
trail, and an immutable commit SHA. This fixture satisfies only the
local-substrate gate, never production.

## Why the gate requires distinct refs

Conflating "evidence I reviewed" and "approval I granted" defeats the purpose of
the managed-offering gate — a reviewer could approve their own evidence without
a second human in the loop. Even in this fixture file, the lesson is preserved:
the two paths point at different files so the gate code can be exercised
end-to-end.

## Local-substrate scope

The local worker is reachable only from the docker network
(`prove-no-public-leak.sh` enforces this). No user traffic is served by the
local worker, so the fixture approval is acceptable for local smoke runs.
Production deploys reject this fixture because the ref hostname
(`github.com/tako0614/takos.git`) doesn't match the production approval repo and
the digest sha256 doesn't match the production evidence file.
