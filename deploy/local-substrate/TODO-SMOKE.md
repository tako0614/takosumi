# Local-substrate smoke TODO

Remaining items after the false-confidence cleanup pass. Each needs either
upstream product work or a coordination call (out of scope of the test bed
itself).

## Workers-profile kernel — LANDED (local Miniflare smoke as of 2026-05-17)

`takosumi/deploy/cloudflare/` is the Worker-first kernel scaffold. It bundles
`deploy/cloudflare/src/worker.ts`, runs the kernel in-process through
`createPaaSApp`, persists kernel snapshots / public deploy records in D1, and
stores artifacts in R2. It has no Cloudflare Container binding.

The local-substrate now runs that same bundle under Miniflare:

1. `takosumi-kernel-worker-build` bundles
   `takosumi/deploy/cloudflare/src/worker.ts`.
2. `takosumi-kernel-worker` serves it at `kernel-worker.takos.test` during the
   default postgres-profile smoke so the normal Takos product stack can keep
   using the Deno+Postgres kernel at `kernel.takos.test`.
3. `kernel-workers` is the replacement workers-profile service, aliasing itself
   as `kernel` when `--profile workers` is selected.
4. `scripts/workers-cli-smoke.sh` now verifies both workerd code paths: the
   Accounts Worker on D1/R2 and the Takosumi kernel Worker on D1/R2/Queue/DO
   (`/healthz`, `/__takosumi/exports/*` signature rejection, `/storage/healthz`,
   `/coordination/healthz`, `/queue/test`, and `/health`). It uses
   `kernel-worker.takos.test` for the postgres-profile mirror and
   `kernel.takos.test` for the workers profile.

## Tenant isolation — LANDED (smoke strict as of 2026-05-17)

`scripts/tenant-isolation.sh` runs in strict mode (subject B's cross-read of
subject A's installation must be non-200). The upstream fix lives in
`takosumi-cloud/packages/accounts-service/src/installation-routes.ts` —
`handleGetAppInstallation` + `handleListAppInstallations` now go through
`requireAccountSession()` + `subjectCanAccessAccount()` (see
`account-session.ts`). CI runs the strict smoke directly, so any regression back
to the open behavior is a hard FAIL.

## Full ActivityPub Follow → Accept federation smoke — LANDED (strict as of 2026-05-17)

`scripts/federation-smoke.sh` brings up `yurucommu-a` and `yurucommu-b` on
inst-a.takos.test / inst-b.takos.test and verifies:

- both nodeinfo + webfinger respond
- cross-instance reach through Caddy

`scripts/federation-follow.sh` now covers the full happy path:

1. **No public signup endpoint exists.** yurucommu is a single-user instance, so
   `POST /api/auth/login` returns the pre-existing `owner` actor (or creates a
   default "tako" owner the first time) gated on a PBKDF2-hashed
   `AUTH_PASSWORD_HASH` env var. `POST /api/auth/accounts` creates sub-accounts
   but requires an already-signed-in actor. So provisioning two distinct
   subjects on inst-a vs inst-b means each instance gets the same "tako" owner
   under a separate `APP_URL`, which is fine for federation testing (the actors
   have different `ap_id`s).
2. **`POST /api/auth/login` now has deterministic local-substrate fixtures** in
   `env/yurucommu-{a,b}.env`, so the smoke can create / reuse each instance's
   default owner actor with one known fixture password.
3. **`POST /api/follow` is the internal create-Follow hook.** The strict smoke
   reaches it with a valid session and body, and yurucommu's
   local-substrate-only guard allows HTTPS `*.takos.test` actor fetches only
   when `YURUCOMMU_ENABLE_LOCAL_SUBSTRATE_REMOTE_FETCHES=true` and local DNS
   resolves to `127.0.0.1` or Docker bridge `172.16.0.0/12`.
4. **Deno mode now has local delivery queue bindings.**
   `YURUCOMMU_ENABLE_DENO_DELIVERY_QUEUE=true` attaches an in-memory
   Queue-compatible drain in `src/backend/server.ts`, so the existing Worker
   queue path runs locally without adding remote POSTs to request handlers.
5. **The strict assertion polls accepted relations.** The script fails unless
   inst-b's followers collection contains inst-a and inst-a's following
   collection contains inst-b, proving Follow delivery, Accept emission, and
   accepted-state finalization.

## brand-tokens JSR package (D13)

Today `takos/website/src/styles/{tokens,global}.css` is a 691-line fork of
`takosumi/website/src/styles/global.css`. They will drift. The right fix is a
small JSR package `@takos/brand-tokens` shipping:

- `tokens.css` — colors / typography / spacing / radii
- `components/{GeometricMark,InkdropMark,Wordmark}.tsx` — framework- agnostic
  mark + wordmark components

Then both takos/website and takosumi/website import from JSR. Out of scope of
the test bed (publishing a new JSR scope + coordination with takosumi/website +
landing PRs across multiple repos).

## smoke.d/ full split (D17 — partial)

scripts/smoke.sh has a `run_script <label> <cmd>` helper that captures
stdout+stderr to `$SMOKE_LOG_DIR/<label>.log` on failure. CI uploads that dir as
an artifact. Today the helper is plumbed into a few key checks (oauth, passkey,
stripe, federation, kernel-deploy). The full refactor to per-script files under
`scripts/smoke.d/*.sh` with auto- discovery is mechanical but bigger; not
strictly necessary now that log capture works.

## wrangler dev --remote

Closer-to-prod test against real Cloudflare bindings (KV / DO / Queues / D1).
Requires:

- Cloudflare account credentials (CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN env)
- `wrangler-staging.toml` separate from production
- Staging-only D1 / KV / DO namespaces

Add as a separate `scripts/wrangler-remote-smoke.sh` that's opt-in (not in the
default smoke run) and reads creds from the user's keychain or 1Password CLI.

Today's miniflare-based cloud worker smoke catches the _code_ path; this would
catch the _infrastructure_ path (binding semantics that miniflare emulates
imperfectly: Queue ordering, DO single-instance guarantees, KV eventual
consistency).
