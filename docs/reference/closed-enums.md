This page is the index of every Takosumi v1 closed enum and state
machine. Each entry lists the values, gives a one-line semantic, and
links to the dedicated reference for details. Every enum below is
**closed**: extension requires a `CONVENTIONS.md` §6 RFC. No provider,
template, or third-party package may extend any of these unilaterally.

## What "v1 stable wire shape" covers

`Stability: stable` doc が freeze する v1 wire shape の対象は以下:

- **closed enum 値** (本 doc に列挙されたすべての enum)
- **state machine の状態名と遷移**
- **record schema の field 名と型**
- **HTTP endpoint path と request / response の field 名**
  ([Kernel HTTP API](/reference/kernel-http-api))
- **CLI subcommand 名と flag 名** ([CLI](/reference/cli))
- **audit event 名と payload field 名** ([Audit Events](/reference/audit-events))
- **environment variable 名** ([Environment Variables](/reference/env-vars))
- **resource ID prefix と format** ([Resource IDs](/reference/resource-ids))

これらは v1 中の breaking 変更に `CONVENTIONS.md` §6 RFC を必須とする。
operator-tunable な default 値 (TTL / grace / threshold / quota cap 等)
は wire shape ではないため、stable の対象外で、default 値変更は
CHANGELOG への記載のみで足りる ([Stability](/reference/#stability) 参照)。

## Access modes

```text
read | read-write | admin | invoke-only | observe-only
```

Five-value vocabulary that governs how a Link consumer interacts with
an export's resource. `read-write` and `admin` are never implicit on
`safeDefaultAccess`. Detailed semantics, `safeDefaultAccess` contract,
and approval invalidation interaction live in
[Access Modes](/reference/access-modes).

## Lifecycle phases

```text
apply | activate | destroy | rollback | recovery | observe
```

Six-phase enum applied per OperationPlan. `apply` produces the
`OperationPlan` and `ResolutionSnapshot`; `activate` flips traffic;
`destroy` removes managed and generated objects; `rollback` re-applies
the prior `ResolutionSnapshot`; `recovery` resumes from the WAL after
a kernel restart or lock loss; `observe` runs long-lived against
runtime-agent describe. Phase-by-phase inputs, WAL stage coverage,
failure semantics, and the steady-state transition diagram live in
[Lifecycle Phases](/reference/lifecycle-phases).

## LifecycleStatus

```text
running | stopped | missing | error | unknown
```

Five-value state runtime-agent reports per managed object. It is the
observed state of the object on its backing connector, never a
control-plane phase. Trigger-by-trigger transitions for `apply` /
`describe` / `destroy` / `verify` are defined in
[Lifecycle Phases — LifecycleStatus enum](/reference/lifecycle-phases#lifecyclestatus-enum).

## operationKind

```text
apply-object | delete-object | verify-object
materialize-link | rematerialize-link | revoke-link
prepare-exposure | activate-exposure
transform-data-asset | observe | compensate
```

Eleven-value closed enum on every `OperationRecord.operationKind` in
plan output and on every operation that the kernel dispatches to a
provider implementation.

| Value                  | Meaning                                                                                          |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `apply-object`         | Create or update a managed object on its connector.                                              |
| `delete-object`        | Remove a managed object during `destroy` or `rollback`.                                          |
| `verify-object`        | Re-read a managed object to confirm it matches the resolved spec; emits no mutation.             |
| `materialize-link`     | Render a generated object from a link source for the first time.                                 |
| `rematerialize-link`   | Re-render a generated object after the source export digest changed.                             |
| `revoke-link`          | Tear down a generated object when the link is removed; may emit `RevokeDebt`.                    |
| `prepare-exposure`     | Stage a new Exposure (build routing surface) before traffic flips.                               |
| `activate-exposure`    | Flip traffic to a prepared Exposure during the `activate` phase.                                 |
| `transform-data-asset` | Run a DataAsset transformer to produce a derived artifact.                                       |
| `observe`              | Long-lived runtime-agent describe used by the `observe` phase.                                   |
| `compensate`           | Recovery operation that undoes a partially-committed effect during `rollback` / `recovery`.      |

Per-kind input / output / WAL stage coverage lives in
[Plan Output Schema](/reference/plan-output) and provider dispatch
contract in
[Provider Implementation Contract](/reference/provider-implementation-contract).

## WAL stages

```text
prepare | pre-commit | commit | post-commit | observe | finalize
        | abort | skip                                  (terminal)
```

Eight-value enum for the write-ahead operation journal. `prepare` /
`pre-commit` / `commit` / `post-commit` / `observe` / `finalize` are
the forward stages; `abort` and `skip` are the terminal stages. The
idempotency tuple is `(spaceId, operationPlanDigest, journalEntryId)`;
the same tuple replayed from any forward stage produces the same
result. Detailed stage semantics and replay rules will live in
[WAL Stages](/reference/wal-stages).

## Approval lifecycle states

```text
pending | approved | denied | expired | invalidated | consumed
```

Six-value closed server-side state machine for approval records.
`pending` is the initial state on issue; `approved`, `denied`,
`expired`, `invalidated`, `consumed` are the five terminal states.
`approved` is the only non-terminal post-issue state, transitioning
to `consumed` when the apply pipeline successfully consumes the
approval, or to `invalidated` when one of the six triggers below
fires. `consumed` records are retained for audit but cannot be
re-used; presenting a `consumed` approval to apply yields
`failed_precondition`. The transient client-only `reviewing` UX
hint is not a server-side state and is not persisted. Transition
contract and binding fields live in
[Approval Invalidation Triggers](/reference/approval-invalidation#approver-ux-states).

## Approval invalidation triggers

```text
1. digest change
2. effect-detail change
3. implementation change
4. external freshness change
5. catalog release change
6. Space-context change
```

Six independent triggers; any one firing invalidates the approval.
`digest change` and `effect-detail change` short-circuit-invalidate
without re-evaluating other bindings, since a digest move forces a
full re-resolve. Trigger contract and propagation rules live in
[Approval Invalidation Triggers](/reference/approval-invalidation).

## Risk taxonomy

```text
collision-detected | transform-unapproved | stale-export
revoke-debt-created | secret-projection | grant-escalation
network-egress-expansion | cross-space-import
external-implementation | catalog-release-bump
policy-pack-bump | space-context-change
artifact-policy-override | post-commit-failed
recovery-compensate-required | drift-detected
data-asset-kind-mismatch | approval-binding-stale
implementation-change
```

Nineteen-value closed Risk enum with stable IDs. The kernel issues
one approval per `OperationPlan` and lists the firing Risks via
`riskItemIds[]`. Per-Risk semantics and the operator-fix flow live in
[Risk Taxonomy](/reference/risk-taxonomy).

## RevokeDebt reason

```text
external-revoke | link-revoke | activation-rollback
approval-invalidated | cross-space-share-expired
```

Five-value closed reason enum on `RevokeDebt`. `external-revoke` is
emitted when the connector reports an object disappeared without a
managed `destroy`; `link-revoke` covers explicit projection removal;
`activation-rollback` covers `compensate` recovery. See
[RevokeDebt Model](/reference/revoke-debt).

## RevokeDebt status

```text
open | operator-action-required | cleared
```

Three-value lifecycle status of a `RevokeDebt` entry. `open` is the
default state at emission; `operator-action-required` is set when
automatic clearing failed and the aging window crossed the operator
threshold; `cleared` is terminal. Aging window and clear conditions
live in [RevokeDebt Model](/reference/revoke-debt).

## Object lifecycle classes

```text
managed | generated | external | operator | imported
```

Five-value closed classification of every object the kernel tracks.

| Class       | Meaning                                                                                              |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `managed`   | Created and owned by the current Space's apply pipeline; destroyed by its `destroy` phase.           |
| `generated` | Materialized from a managed object via projection / link rendering; destroyed when its source is.    |
| `external`  | Pre-existing on the connector; the kernel may read or grant against it but never deletes it.         |
| `operator`  | Operator-installed (e.g. `connector:<id>`); not part of any tenant Space's lifecycle.                |
| `imported`  | Reachable through a SpaceExportShare from another Space; lifecycle bound to the share's freshness.   |

Only `managed` and `generated` are removed by `destroy`.

## Mutation constraints

```text
immutable | replace-only | in-place | append-only
ordered-replace | reroute-only
```

Six-value closed enum that an `outputField` carries to declare how a
provider may mutate it across applies.

| Constraint        | Allowed apply behavior                                                                  |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `immutable`       | Value is fixed at first apply; later changes fail planning.                             |
| `replace-only`    | Provider must drop and re-create the resource to change the value.                      |
| `in-place`        | Provider may mutate the field on the live resource without re-creation.                 |
| `append-only`     | Provider may extend the value but not remove or reorder existing entries.               |
| `ordered-replace` | Provider may replace entries but must preserve declared ordering.                       |
| `reroute-only`    | Provider may not touch the resource itself; only the routing surface in front of it.    |

## Link mutations

```text
rematerialize | reproject | regrant | rewire | revoke
retain-generated | no-op | repair
```

Eight-value closed enum on the per-link diff the apply pipeline emits
into the OperationPlan.

| Mutation           | Trigger                                                                                       |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `rematerialize`    | Source export digest changed; generated object re-derived from the new export.                |
| `reproject`        | Projection rule changed without source change; only generated identity is re-rendered.        |
| `regrant`          | Grant detail (e.g. access mode) changed; underlying object kept.                              |
| `rewire`           | Routing target changed; managed object kept, exposure rebuilt.                                |
| `revoke`           | Link removed; generated object torn down; may emit `RevokeDebt` of reason `link-revoke`.      |
| `retain-generated` | Link removed but operator policy retains the generated object (e.g. for audit).               |
| `no-op`            | Link present in both snapshots with identical materialization.                                |
| `repair`           | Drift detected; generated state reconciled to match the resolved link.                        |

## Link materialization states

```text
pending | materializing | materialized | stale | rematerializing
revoking | revoked | failed | debt
```

Nine-value closed state on each link projection inside a
`ResolutionSnapshot`. `materialized` is steady-state success;
`stale` flags an export-freshness issue without yet re-running;
`debt` indicates a `RevokeDebt` is open against the link.

## DataAsset kinds

```text
oci-image | js-module | wasm-module | static-archive | source-archive
```

Five-value closed enum on every `Artifact.kind`. Required metadata,
size caps, signature requirements, and cache policy per kind live in
[Artifact Kinds](/reference/artifact-kinds).

## Health states

```text
unknown | observing | healthy | degraded | unhealthy
```

Five-value Exposure health enum reported by the observe loop. Newly
activated Exposures start at `unknown`, transition through
`observing`, then settle on `healthy` / `degraded` / `unhealthy`. The
transitions are described in
[Lifecycle Phases — `observe`](/reference/lifecycle-phases#observe).

## DomainErrorCode

```text
invalid_argument | permission_denied | not_found
failed_precondition | resource_exhausted | not_implemented
unauthenticated | readiness_probe_failed | internal_error
```

Nine-value closed code enum on every kernel domain error response.

| Code                     | Meaning                                                                                  |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `invalid_argument`       | Manifest schema, form input, or digest mismatch.                                         |
| `permission_denied`      | Space crossing, entitlement denial, or policy gate denial.                               |
| `not_found`              | Endpoint disabled (token unset), or deployment / artifact / Space absent.                |
| `failed_precondition`    | Destroy without prior record, collision-detected, or approval invalidated.               |
| `resource_exhausted`     | Quota saturation or artifact upload exceeding `TAKOSUMI_ARTIFACT_MAX_BYTES`.             |
| `not_implemented`        | Issuer not wired, or operator-gated feature not enabled.                                 |
| `unauthenticated`        | Missing bearer or internal HMAC verification failure.                                    |
| `readiness_probe_failed` | `/livez` / `/readyz` or a dependent port is not ready.                                   |
| `internal_error`         | Unhandled exception inside the kernel.                                                   |

Transport mapping (HTTP status, gRPC code) is fixed per code and
defined in [Kernel HTTP API](/reference/kernel-http-api). Manifest-time
validation that surfaces `invalid_argument` is described in
[Manifest Validation](/reference/manifest-validation).

## LifecycleErrorBody codes

```text
unauthorized | bad_request | connector_not_found
artifact_kind_mismatch | connector_failed
```

Five-value closed code enum returned by runtime-agent
`/v1/lifecycle/*` responses. The `connector-extended:*` prefix is
reserved for connector-defined extension codes that runtime-agent
forwards verbatim. See
[Runtime-Agent API — Error model](/reference/runtime-agent-api#error-model).

## SpaceExportShare lifecycle

```text
draft | active | refresh-required | stale | revoked
```

Five-value closed share lifecycle. `draft` is pre-publish;
`active` is consumable; `refresh-required` flags freshness loss
that operators may resolve without revoking; `stale` is the
threshold-crossed terminal-but-recoverable state; `revoked` is
terminal. See [Space Export Share](/reference/space-export-share).

## Actor types

```text
human | service-account | runtime-agent | support-staff
```

Four-value closed enum on every Actor record. `human` is an
operator-onboarded user; `service-account` is a non-interactive
caller bound to an API key; `runtime-agent` is an enrolled
runtime-agent process; `support-staff` is an operator-side
support principal subject to impersonation grants. Per-type
binding fields and authentication contract live in
[Actor / Organization Model](/reference/actor-organization-model).

## Roles

```text
org-owner | org-admin | org-billing | space-admin
space-deployer | space-viewer | support-staff
```

Seven-value closed RBAC role enum. `org-*` roles bind at
Organization scope; `space-*` roles bind at Space scope;
`support-staff` is operator-scope and gated by an active
impersonation grant. Per-role capability matrix and scope rules
live in [RBAC Policy](/reference/rbac-policy).

## API key types

```text
deploy-token | read-token | admin-token | support-token
```

Four-value closed enum on every API key record. `deploy-token`
authorizes apply / activate / destroy; `read-token` is read-only;
`admin-token` covers Organization / Space management; `support-token`
is operator-scope and only valid while a matching impersonation
grant is `approved`. Prefix grammar, rotation, and revocation rules
live in [API Key Management](/reference/api-key-management).

## Auth provider types

```text
bearer-token | oidc | mtls | runtime-agent-enrollment
```

Four-value closed enum on every auth provider plug-in. `bearer-token`
is the default API key path; `oidc` accepts external OIDC issuers
mapped to Actors; `mtls` binds a client certificate chain; and
`runtime-agent-enrollment` is the bootstrap path for runtime-agent
processes. Verification protocol and claim mapping live in
[Auth Providers](/reference/auth-providers).

## Trial Space lifecycle

```text
active-trial | expiring-soon | frozen | cleaned-up | converted
```

Five-value closed lifecycle enum on Trial Space records.
`active-trial` is the issued steady state; `expiring-soon` flags
the window before auto-expire; `frozen` halts apply / activate
while preserving data; `cleaned-up` is terminal after hard
delete; `converted` is terminal after upgrade to a regular Space.
Transition contract and quota envelope live in
[Trial Spaces](/reference/trial-spaces).

## Incident state

```text
detecting | acknowledged | mitigating | monitoring | resolved | postmortem
```

Six-value closed Incident state machine. `detecting` is the
initial state on emit; `acknowledged` records operator
acceptance; `mitigating` covers active remediation; `monitoring`
is post-fix observation; `resolved` is the terminal operational
state; `postmortem` is the terminal record-keeping state. Per-
state transitions live in [Incident Model](/reference/incident-model).

## Incident severity

```text
low | medium | high | critical
```

Four-value closed severity enum on each Incident. Severity
controls notification emission and SLA-breach linkage. Per-
severity policy lives in [Incident Model](/reference/incident-model).

## Support impersonation grant lifecycle

```text
requested | approved | rejected | revoked | expired
```

Five-value closed grant lifecycle enum. `requested` is the
initial state on issue; `approved` is the only operational
state in which a `support-token` may be used; `rejected`,
`revoked`, and `expired` are terminal. Per-state binding and
audit contract live in
[Support Impersonation](/reference/support-impersonation).

## SLA state

```text
ok | warning | breached | recovering | ok-recovered
```

Five-value closed SLA evaluation state. `ok` is the steady
state; `warning` flags an approaching threshold; `breached`
is recorded when the SLO threshold is crossed;
`recovering` indicates re-entry below the threshold but
inside the cooldown window; `ok-recovered` is the terminal
record after cooldown success. Detection and cooldown rules
live in [SLA Breach Detection](/reference/sla-breach-detection).

## Connector identity

Connector identity uses the closed prefix `connector:<id>`. Every
connector is operator-installed and falls under the `operator`
object lifecycle class above. The identity scheme is closed; no
other prefix denotes a connector in v1.
